# mcSPWNcraft
## What is this?
To be simple - A dump, a dump of a CC: Tweaked/Open Computers project, to "Tweak" the experience of your PC(inside of Minecraft of course) with custom commands and other stuff

## Explanation
In the repo there are 2 folders: CC and OC
CC is for "Computer Craft: Tweaked" mod/fork
OC is for "Open Computers" mod

It's made that way due to these mods being really similar but with a bit different serving and the team liking both mods

## Commands
* Start - Starts the project | Added due to not having a way to launch programs outside of /mcspwncraft/
* Print - Prints anything after it | Added because CraftOS doesn't have it

## Installation(CC: Tweaked)
* Create a Minecraft 1.15.2 world with CC:Tweaked of [this](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cc-tweaked/download/3408526) version. 
* Place a computer in your world
* Download the repo
* Throw it in .minecraft/saves/Your World/computercraft/computers/Id Of Your Computer(should be 1)
* When in Minecraft again, check the directories with "ls" if all done correct you should see "mcspwncraft" 

## Startup(CC: Tweaked)
So to make the programs from /mcspwncraft/cc/ global:
* Go to /mcspwncraft/cc/
* Type in "start" and press enter
